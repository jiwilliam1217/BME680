# 🌡️ BME680 Temperature Sensor with DOG LCD Display on AVR

This project demonstrates how to interface a BME680 environmental sensor and a DOG LCD with an AVR microcontroller using I2C and SPI protocols.
The BME680 sensor provides raw temperature readings, and the LCD is used to display data.

## ⚙️ Features

- Initializes BME680 and LCD modules.
- Reads sensor ID/status from BME680.

## 🛠️ Hardware

- Microchip AVR128DB48
- BME680 sensor (I2C)
- DOG LCD display (SPI)
